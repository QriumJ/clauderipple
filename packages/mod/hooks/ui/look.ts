// The skin (2026-10-14): which pictures the desktop draws with and what colours its host Text takes.
// The deep (art.ts) is the first look: dark water on either theme, 리플이's glow, drawn controls in
// glass. Flat (flat.ts) is the app's own surfaces: a hairline card that follows the theme, the
// host's own ink, the accent only where something is on. Those two share one layout and change
// paint alone: every size is art.ts's and every cell count the same under both, so band.tsx's
// arithmetic and the blank presses laid over the pictures (kit.tsx) hold whatever the skin. The
// terminal draws text and knows nothing of skins.
