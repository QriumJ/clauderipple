// Durable message receipts: (session, clientMsgId) → pending → completed, on disk under the

// behavior: a resend of a completed id is acknowledged without running again; a resend that
// finds a pending receipt left from before a host restart answers `outcome_unknown` instead of
// running again — the phone shows "전송 결과를 확인할 수 없음 — 다시 보내기 / 무시" for it).

// The key covers what Paseo digests as ["send", agentId, messageId]: our key is
// `send:<session>:<clientMsgId>` for turns and `create:<clientMsgId>` for session creation
// (no session exists yet). In-flight keys of this process are tracked in memory so a concurrent
// resend rides the first attempt instead of reading its pending receipt as an orphan.
