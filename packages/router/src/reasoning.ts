// A translated reasoning model's own turn, carried through Claude Code's transcript.
//
// The Responses wire hands its model an opaque reasoning item — `{type:"reasoning", id, summary,
// encrypted_content}` — and expects it back, byte for byte, in the position it came from, beside the
// function calls of that same turn. That is not an optimisation: measured 2026-10-14 with Muse Spark
// 1.3 at xhigh on a real tool loop, runs whose previous reasoning was not returned spent
// 9.5k–24.5k reasoning tokens each (2,197 per step past 80k context) and one of three ran out of
// context without ever answering, where the same loop with the items returned spent 3.2k–4.3k per
// run (725 per step past 80k), answered in all three, and read 94% prompt cache. Dropping the reasoning is why a routed worker "thinks from
// scratch on every tool call" and then dies. DeepSeek's own Chat API states the same rule for
// `reasoning_content`: with `tools` present it "must be fully passed back to the API in all
// subsequent requests", even for turns that made no tool call, and the API answers a 400 otherwise
// (https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode/, read 2026-10-14).
//
// The router keeps no state of its own here. Claude Code resends the whole conversation every turn,
// so the transcript is the storage. The carrier is a `thinking` block's `signature`, which is a
// free-form string on the wire and is replayed with the block [measured 2026-10-14 against a fake
// upstream: a thinking block carrying our signature comes back on the next request of a tool loop
// with the signature byte-identical, and an *empty* thinking text is kept too — which is what a
// Responses reasoning item with no summary looks like]. Anthropic's own signature is opaque base64
// this router cannot forge; ours is a small envelope that names the wire, the provider, the model
// and the vendor's own reasoning, and it is decoded and dropped by `thinking.ts` before a request
// reaches Anthropic.
//
// opencodex (github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex, devlog/_fin/260711_claude_inbound/003_evidence.md
// lines 93-118) reached the same conclusion and the same carrier — a signature on a thinking block,
// read back out of the client's own conversation — and we rely on that as a behavioral
// specification only; no code was copied.
//
// `encrypted_content` is the vendor's own sealed blob. It goes in the envelope untouched and comes
// back untouched: re-encoding or re-signing it would be the "re-signed reasoning" mistake that cost
// an earlier translator 12–20% cache hit (ARCHITECTURE §4, "Cache-safety decisions").
//
// `include:["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` is asked for on every turn where the vendor is known to
// take it — the ChatGPT backend, as Codex asks, and a preset marked `sealedReasoning` (presets.ts),
// as OpenCode's own client asks. A `store: false` backend that is not asked hands back nothing, so
// waiting until a conversation already carried reasoning would never start one. For any other
// Responses vendor it is asked for only once the conversation already carries that vendor's
// reasoning, so a vendor never measured keeps the request it had. Measured 2026-10-14 against
// OpenCode Go (`muse-spark-1.3-contributor`, one tool-bearing turn): the sealed item came back with
// `include` and without it, both 1426 bytes, and replaying it in place answered 200. The same vendor
// also accepted a tampered blob and a turn with the item dropped entirely (both 200), so the 4xx
// retry below is a safety net for a vendor or an account that is stricter.
