//
//   dist/cli/src/index.js        the CLI, and with it the supervisor and installer
//   dist/router/src/index.js     the router
//   dist/ui/                     the dashboard, served by the router's admin API
//   dist/mod/                    the status mod, a plugin folder Claude Code loads
//   dist/app/dist/main.js        the tray, with dist/app/assets (tray and app icons) next to it as it expects
